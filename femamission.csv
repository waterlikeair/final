","Consistent with President Trumps Memorandum Providing Federal Support for Governors Use of the National Guard to Respond to COVID-19, dated 3 August 2020, to assist the State of Nebraska to respond to the threats and hazards caused by COVID-19, FEMA requests DoD provide essential assistance support to the State of Nebraska.  Pursuant to President Trumps Memoranda, FEMA can fully reimburse DoD for this support if DoD requests that States order National Guard Forces to perform duty to fulfill this mission assignment.  DOD will execute the MA as directed by and in coordination with FEMA, and will: Provide essential assistance to meet the immediate threats to life resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak as authorized by Sections 403 (42 U.S.C. 5170b) of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, Public Law 93-288, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq., to support COVID-19 operations in Nebraska.  National Guard units under state control will execute critical missions to save lives and protect the public health and safety. Eligible activities are limited to Emergency Protective Measures, as outlined in COVID-19 specific Public Assistance policy or otherwise authorized by FEMA.  Safety and security missions, not to include law enforcement activities, are authorized as part of this MA.  Effective 8/22/2020, eligible costs under this MA include pay, allowances, travel to place National Guard personnel on Title 32 orders, and per diem. Eligible expenses will also include: 1. Operating costs for DoD equipment already in DoD stocks necessary to fulfill the MA; and 2. Equipment and supplies that only DoD can purchase and that are necessary to fulfill the requirements of the MA, and pre-approved by the FEMA project Manager, 3. Lastly, additional eligible expenses authorized in writing by ORR leadership Employment costs (supplies, equipment, etc.) will be the responsibility of the state, and ineligible MA expenses may be submitted for reimbursement consideration to FEMA via a Public Assistance Project Worksheet. FEMA can offer 100% reimbursement to DOD for this support, if it is executed with National Guard personnel under Title 32 pursuant to the Presidents August 3 proclamation on Providing Federal Support for Governors Use of the National Guard to Respond to COVID-19.
DOD will deploy with appropriate command and control, support personnel, and equipment as required.  In support of this activity, the State will develop a transition plan for this support that will reflect the current mission sets, the conditions required to either terminate or transition the missions, the means of transition (i.e., contracted, other state agency, or National Guard in state active-duty), and the projected timeline to transition.  States will submit the initial plan to FEMA not later than 45 days after this mission assignment is executed and will provide an update on the status of transition no later than 60 days prior to final date T-32 authorized via Presidential Memoranda. All local, State, and non-DoD national assets are exhausted or do not have the capacity to meet this requirement. - Activation of agency command center(s), if required, must be coordinated with FEMA as a separate MA. - The mission-assigned agency is responsible for ensuring that all activity is properly authorized, goods are received, services are provided, and that costs are reasonable and supported by documentation maintained by the respective agency. - MAs shall be considered for closure after 180 days with no financial activity in accordance with FEMA CFO Bulletin #157.
